## Installation
No installation required. You can:
1. Use the **[live web version](https://franbar1966.github.io/Telegram-Ban-Bypass/public/)**, or

## How It Works
The tool bypasses restrictions by:
- Using Telegram's public widget API which isn't subject to regional bans
- Employing multiple CORS proxies with automatic fallback
- Dynamically loading posts in reverse chronological order
- Automatically detecting and removing deleted posts
- Caching responses to improve performance

## Usage

   - Channel name (e.g., `ORANGETERAPY`)
   - @ format (e.g., `@ORANGETERAPY`)
   - Full URL (e.g., `https://t.me/ORANGETERAPY`)
2. Click "Load Channel"
3. Use "Load More Posts" to view older content
4. Access recently viewed channels from the history panel

## Enhanced Features
